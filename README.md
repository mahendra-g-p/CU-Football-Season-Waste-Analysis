# CU-Football-Season-Waste-Analysis

This repository contains the code and analysis for the "CU Football Season Waste Analysis" project, which aims to explore the waste management practices and diversion rates during the football season at the University of Colorado (CU). The project is a collaborative effort led by Mahendra Gajula Pothamsetty and Manasa Kolavennu, with support and expertise from Angie Gilbert (Zero Waste Events Manager) and Robin Poley (Zero Waste Event Program Assistant) from the CU Environmental Center.

Dataset:
The dataset used in this analysis is provided in the "data" folder of this repository. It contains historical data collected during CU football seasons, including information on waste generation and diversion rates. The dataset consists of multiple columns representing different waste-related variables and their respective values for each game.

Analysis:
The analysis is performed using R programming language, and the code is available in the "analysis.R" file. It includes data preprocessing steps, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, linear regression modeling, model selection, and evaluation. The goal of the analysis is to identify significant factors that impact the waste diversion rate during football games and build a predictive model to estimate the diversion rate based on these factors.

Usage:
The code and analysis provided in this repository can serve as a reference for similar waste management studies or sustainability initiatives. Researchers, waste management professionals, and individuals interested in understanding and improving waste diversion practices can explore the code and adapt it to their own datasets or contexts.

Note: This project is part of a larger effort by CU Environmental Center to promote sustainable waste management practices and raise awareness about the importance of reducing waste and increasing diversion rates during football games.

Please feel free to explore the repository, provide feedback, and use the code and analysis for educational or research purposes.
